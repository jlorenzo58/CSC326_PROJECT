# Implemented bubble, selection, quick, merge and insertion sort and measured the performance of the algorithms in terms of number of steps and CPU running time.
## Input is n number of numbers to be sorted and program generates three instances : sorted, reversely sorted, and random permuation.
## Output is average running time and average number of steps for each generated instances.
